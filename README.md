# data-visualizations

A repository of data visualizations I did over time.

## Setup

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements
```

## Enjoy

With this environment you just setup, you can enjoy all the jupyter notebooks in this repo.

```
source venv/Scripts/activate
jupyter notebook
```

Or just open the folder in VSCode and select the python environment as kernel.
